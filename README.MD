Colour Photo
<hr>
These colour was choosen to assimilate the map colour. I am tying to avoid colours that can affect color blindess deficiency such as red, yellow and green. But, sometime you’ve no choice so I used yellow because some color  didn’t work with CSS.

Limitations and Future Implementations: 
<hr>
Due to constrain,  I am unable find another meaningful API to add-on to the L.Control. Nevertheless, I shall improvise when the next opportunity. Arise, and also to add on more feature.  Note: sometime  unable to to grab a photo and info.  I suspect the problem is on four square side whatever information that is unavailable.
