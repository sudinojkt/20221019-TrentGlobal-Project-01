Limitations and Future Implementations: 
<hr>
Subjected to constrain, I'm unable find a meaningful API to add-on at the moment and make use of the L.Control. But, I shall try again the next opportunity arise and also add more features in this project. <b>Note:<b> The search result sometime unable to grab photo and info. I suspect this limitation lies with the fetching or pushing of data to Four Square.
